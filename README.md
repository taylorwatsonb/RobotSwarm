# Robot Swarm Simulation

A Mesa-based robot swarm simulation modeling autonomous robots that complete tasks while managing battery levels. Features:

- Dynamic task allocation system
- Battery management and charging behavior 
- Real-time visualization of swarm efficiency
- Performance metrics and charts
- Autonomous navigation

The simulation demonstrates emergent behavior of robot swarms as they coordinate to complete tasks while managing their energy levels.
